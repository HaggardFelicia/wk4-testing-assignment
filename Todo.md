## Week 4 Second Collection Assignment

- [ ] You will finish your second collection (Model).
You will need to:

  - [ ] Use select() to exclude info like version
  - [x] Use populate to display your first collection (model) in your second model
  - [ ] In all the (id) functions check to see if the object is in the database first, if so, then display "object" not found, like in the examples. (GET by ID, etc.)
  - [ ] Put your hardcoded messages in a Messages module
  - [ ] When posting your second collection use the id from the first collection, (found in MongoDB)
  - [ ] Use Postman to view ALL your function payloads
